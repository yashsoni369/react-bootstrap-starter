# React JS Bootstrap Boilerplate

A javascript based react project which contains all the essential startup files. 

# Features

1. Bootstrap, Jquery, Popper.js Included
2. SASS Support (Custom theme.scss file to override bootstrap defaults)
3. Shared Components - Header, Footer, Sidebar.
4. Module wise folder structure
5. Protected Routes with custom logic (JWT Check)
6. Multiple Layouts with nested routing
   1. Admin Layout - with its own Header, Sidebar & Router outlet
   2. App Layout - for general user
   3. Auth Layout - independent pages such as login, register, etc.

# Note
1. There's no layout integrated. This project is merely a skeleton with **One Liner HTML OUTPUT** in each file
2. This repo is not complete, I will be slowly updating the code base.
3. Comments and suggestions are accepted :)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
